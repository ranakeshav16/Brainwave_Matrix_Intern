## 📌 Project Overview

This is a **Python ATM Interface Project** developed during my Python Developer Internship at **Brainwave Matrix Solutions**.  
It is a beginner-friendly program that simulates core ATM operations like:  
- Create Account  
- Login  
- Balance Inquiry  
- Deposit  
- Withdraw  
- Exit  

👉 Data is stored **in-memory** (not saved to a file).
